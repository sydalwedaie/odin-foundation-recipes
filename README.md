# Odin Recipes

The solution to the [Odin Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) project from The Odin Project. Configured using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Handlebars.

## Installation

To install the dependencies and build the project, run the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sydalwedaie/odin-foundation-recipes.git
cd odin-foundations-recipes
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What I learned

I may have gone a bit too far with my Zenful Template. The whole purpose of the template was to simplify my practice project routine. However, I felt like I was making my own framework. My main issue came up trying to build the other pages for this website; namely the recipe pages. I had to modify the Vite config file so that those pages would show up in production. It was too complicated, but I still gained a valuable experience.
